- Added support for components in addition to utilities (#67)
- Added description to custom variant completion items where possible
- Config parsing errors are now displayed in the VS Code UI

  ```json
  {
    "tailwindCSS.includeLanguages": {
      "plaintext": "html"
    }
  }

  This setting allows you to add additional language support. The key of each entry is the new language ID and the value is any one of the extensions built-in languages, depending on how you want the new language to be treated (e.g. `html`, `css`, or `javascript`)

- Added built-in support for `sugarss` language
- Added `theme` (and `config`) helper hovers
- Added `@apply` class name hovers

- Added `@tailwind` completion items (`preflight`/`base`, `utilities`, `components`, `screens`) with links to documentation
- Helper completion items that contain the `.` character will now insert square brackets when selected
- `@apply` completion list now excludes class names that are not compatible
- Added CSS syntax highlighting in `.vue` files (#15)

### JS(X)

- Completions now trigger when using backticks (#50, [#93](https://github.com/tailwindcss/intellisense/issues/93)):
